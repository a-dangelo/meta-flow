Workflow: compliance_check
Description: Run multiple compliance checks in parallel for faster processing

Inputs:
- document_id (string): Document to check for compliance
- compliance_api_key (string): API key for compliance service (SECRET: must be from environment variable or secrets manager, never hardcoded)
- gdpr_endpoint (string): GDPR compliance check endpoint
- sox_endpoint (string): SOX compliance check endpoint
- hipaa_endpoint (string): HIPAA compliance check endpoint

Steps:
1. Fetch document content from document store
2. Run compliance checks in parallel:
   2a. GDPR compliance check on document
   2b. SOX compliance check on document
   2c. HIPAA compliance check on document
3. Aggregate all compliance results
4. Generate compliance report with all findings

Robustness:
- Timeout: 30s per compliance check endpoint
- Retries: Up to 3 attempts with exponential backoff on transient errors
- Failure mode: If any check fails after retries, mark that compliance status as "unknown" and include error in report
- Document store access: Requires authentication token, 15s retrieval timeout, log fetch failures

Outputs:
- gdpr_compliant (boolean): GDPR compliance status
- sox_compliant (boolean): SOX compliance status
- hipaa_compliant (boolean): HIPAA compliance status
- overall_compliant (boolean): Overall compliance status (true only if all checks passed)
- report_url (string): HTTPS URL to compliance report (S3 presigned URL, 7-day retention)
